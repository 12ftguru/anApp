Here are the git commands to create a new anApp project that tracks changes made to the anApp base repository.

First, create a new empty github repo for your new project. Here we call it "myproject". Then:

> git clone http://github.com/12ftguru/anApp.git myproject
> cd myproject
> git remote rm origin
> git remote add origin <your github private clone url, the read/write one>
> git config branch.master.remote origin
> git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
> git push origin master

Basically, we clone anApp, the tell git that anApp isn't the base repo, our new empty one is. Then we push the anApp code to our new repo.

Next we set up our new repo to also know about the anApp base repo:

> git remote add anApp http://github.com/12ftguru/anApp.git


Now when there are changes to anApp you can incorporate them with:

> git fetch anApp master
> git merge anApp/master

Or:

> git pull anApp master
